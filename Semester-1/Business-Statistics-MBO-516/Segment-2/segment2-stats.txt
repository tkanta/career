Dear Learners,

The following topics will be covered during Webinar - 2

Assigning Probabilities to Events
Conditional Probability
Rules of Probability
Probability Trees and Bayes' Rule 
You are requested to go through the Videos and Reading Materials of these topics before attending the webinar which will help you in comprehending the concepts better.


=================================== Webinar ======================================

 
probability is the possible outcome of an event from many
not sure of which one you will get is uncertainity

enahancing the capability of probabilistic situation

	- Diagnostic testing
	- Drug development
	- Market forcasting
	- Investment decision

Random Experiment:
	tossing a coin
	Ec conducting a election

Trial and event:
	 random experiment is called trial and outcome is the event

Sample space:
	total possible outcomes	of an experiment, each outcome is an event.

Exhaustive cases:
	sum of all number of sample space
	sample space is a set, exhaustive case = count# of sample space
	
Favourable cases:
	drawing a spade from 52 is 13

Mutually exclusive cases:
	one or other


Probability
	classical approach
		P() = FC/EC 

	Relative frequency approach:		
		experiment is repeated a lot of time.

	Subjective approach:

Union / intersection / complement of two sets:

condutional probability:

Independent Event:
