Sampling : The process of selecting a subset of population with a view to
study the characteristics of that population.
Estimation: The process of inferring the value of an unknown parameter using
sampling.
Hypothesis: testing The process of testing whether a statement regarding a population
parameter is true using sampling.
Descriptive statistics: Numerical values are computed and used to describe the values in
a data set.
Inferential Statistics: Drawing meaningful predictions from the data by using estimation
and hypothesis testing.

Segment: Descriptive Statistics
Topic: Types of Data

Measurements:
	
	Nominal Scale - 'Nominal' stands for 'name' of category. Such data can only be used to identify or classify a person or thing
	Ordinal Scale - In the ordinal scale or measurement, data elements may be ordered according to their relative size or quality
	Interval Scale - In this case, only the intervals can be compared to produce meaningful ratios
	 Ratio Scale - If two measurements are in ratio scale, then we can take ratios of those measurements. The zero in the scale is absolute zero

Video 3 - Visual Representation of Data
------------------------------------------
Tables:
	Frequency, Pivot	 
Charts
	Histogram, pie, bar
Graphs
	scatter plot, line graph

* Pie and bar charts can be used for both qualitative and quantitative data, while histograms are
for quantitative data.

* What's the 95th percentile? In networking, the 95th percentile is the highest value remaining after the top 5% of a data set is removed. For example, if you have 100 data points, you begin by removing the five largest values. The highest value left represents the 95th percentile.


Exercise 1 - Mean, Median, and Mode
---------------------------------------
Book: Anderson and swiney

120 230 110 115 160 130 150 105 195 155
105 360 120 120 140 100 115 180 235 255

100, 105, 105, 110, 115, 115, 120, 120, 120, 130, 140, 150, 155, 160, 180, 195, 230, 235, 255, 360

Mean : 3200 / 20 = 160
Median : 130+140/2 = 130
Mode: 120

Solution 2 (Demo) - Weighted and Combined Mean
--------------------------------------------------
Weighted mean
	Xw = Sum(Xi * Wi) / Sum(Wi)

Combined Mean
	n1=30, X1 = 40
	n2=50, x2=60

	X12 = (n1*x1 + n2*x2) / (n1+n2)
	X12 = (30*40+50*60) / (30+50) = 4200/80 = 52.5

Exercise 3 - Covariance and Correlation coefficient
---------------------------------------------------
A department of transportationâ€™s study on driving speed and miles per gallon for midsize automobiles resulted in the following data: Speed 
(Miles per Hour): 30 50 40 55 30 25 60 25 50 55 
Miles per Gallon: 28 25 25 23 30 32 21 35 26 25 
a) Develop a scatter diagram and comment. b) Compute and interpret the sample covariance and sample correlation coefficient

Solution:
	* When we say speed and mileage are negatively correlated, it means that typically, as you increase the speed of the vehicle, its mileage or fuel efficiency tends to decrease. This is a common observation due to factors such as increased air resistance (drag) at higher speeds, which requires more energy (fuel) to maintain the same pace. Therefore, when you drive faster, you tend to get fewer miles per gallon or kilometers per liter.

	Mean: X_, Y_
	Sample covariance: Sxy = Sum[(Xi-X_)(Yi-Y_)] / n-1 = -52.7
	Corelation Coefficient: Rxy = Sxy / Sx * Sy = -0.91 
	Std Deviation Sx = Sqrt [Sum{sqare(Xi-X_)} / n-1]
	Std Deviation Sy = Sqrt [Sum{sqare(Yi-Y_)} / n-1]



Exercise 4- Mean, Range & Standard Deviation
---------------------------------------------
For the following data on number of days required to fill orders for Dawson Supply, Inc., and J.C.
Clark Distributors, find the range and standard deviation. Also find who is more consistent and
reliable delivery times.
X: Dawson Supply Days for Delivery: 11 10 9 10 11 11 10 11 10 10
Y: Clark Distributors Days for Delivery: 8 10 13 7 10 11 10 7 15 12

Range = High - Low
	Rx = 11-9=2
	Ry = 15-7=8

	More the variance, lesser the consistency

Std Deviation
	Std Deviation: Sx = sqrt [sum{ square(Xi-X_)} / n-1]
	Coefficient of variation(c.v) = (Sx / Mean(x)) * 100

	Sx = 0.67
	Sy = 2.58
	C.V(X) = 6.5%
	C.V(Y) = 25.05%

	If c.v is less, it is more consistent

The mean has an additional desirable mathematical property:

	* The deviations of all the data points from the mean will add to zero. For example, the mean of
	the data set {5, 7, 8, 10, 10} is 8. The deviations from the mean are {-3, -1, 0, +2, +2} and these
	deviations add to zero. 
	* In a data set, the deviation of each data point from the mean is calculated by subtracting the mean from each data point. Some deviations will be positive (data points above the mean) and some will be negative (data points below the mean). When you add up all these deviations, the sum will always be zero.
	* Yes, indeed. Exploiting the property that the sum of deviations from the mean adds up to zero can simplify algebraic calculations significantly, especially in statistical contexts. This property allows many terms to cancel out when dealing with products of deviations, leading to simpler expressions and computations.

Variance:
	* Thus, a measure of variability can be useful for measuring the quality of machined parts. The smaller the variability the better the
	  quality.	
	* average squared deviation of the data points from their mean

Standard deviation:	
	* The standard deviation of a set of observations is the (positive) square root of the variance of the set.
