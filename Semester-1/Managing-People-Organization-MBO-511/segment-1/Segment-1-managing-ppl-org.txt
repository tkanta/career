- snap judgement
- emotional implosion : 
		Conversely, intense negative emotions may also be internalised
- ventilation fallacy : 
		People may vent their emotions on others in the belief that it will help them feel
		better. However, although shouting and other forms of emotional release may provide
		temporary satisfaction, they do little to restore calm and emotional equilibrium. In fact,
		research has found that this only leads to more brain arousal and anger
